    "question": "What is the vanishing gradient problem?",
    "answer": "The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become extremely small during backpropagation in deep neural networks, making it difficult for earlier layers to learn effectively.",
    "explanation": "This problem particularly affects deep networks with sigmoid or tanh activation functions. As gradients are multiplied during backpropagation, they can become vanishingly small, effectively preventing weight updates in early layers.

    "explanation": "Introduced in the 'Attention Is All You Need' paper, transformers revolutionized NLP by enabling parallel processing and capturing long-range dependencies more effectively than RNNs or CNNs.

    "explanation": "In self-attention, each word in a sequence is represented by a query, key, and value vector. The dot product between a word's query and all keys determines attention weights, which are used to create a weighted sum of values. This allows the model to capture contextual relationships regardless of distance in the sequence.",

    "explanation": "Encoder-only models process the entire input bidirectionally and are ideal for classification and understanding. Decoder-only models generate text autoregressively (one token at a time) with access only to previous tokens. Encoder-decoder models first encode the input sequence, then the decoder generates the output sequence with attention to the encoded representation.",

    "explanation": "While pre-training gives LLMs general language understanding, fine-tuning customizes them for specific applications. This involves updating model weights using a smaller, task-specific dataset.

    "explanation": "Token limits (e.g., 4K, 8K, or 32K tokens) determine how much information the model can access for a given task. This affects the model's ability to handle long documents, maintain context in conversations, or process complex instructions with examples. Exceeding the token limit requires techniques like chunking, summarization, or using retrieval-augmented generation.",

    "explanation": "RAG combines the strengths of retrieval systems (access to up-to-date or domain-specific information) with the generative capabilities of LLMs. This helps overcome knowledge cutoffs, reduces hallucinations, and enables models to reference specific documents or data sources that weren't in their training data.",

    "answer": "Embedding models convert text into numerical vector representations that capture semantic meaning, enabling similarity comparisons and serving as the foundation for retrieval systems that enhance LLMs.",
    "explanation": "While LLMs generate text, embedding models transform text into dense vector spaces where similar concepts are positioned close together. These embeddings power semantic search, clustering, and retrieval systems that can feed relevant information to LLMs. Models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 or sentence-transformers create these vector representations.",

    "explanation": "LLMs optimize for generating fluent, plausible-sounding text rather than factual accuracy. This can lead to confidently stated falsehoods, especially when models are prompted about topics beyond their knowledge.

    "explanation": "Originally developed for military strategy, the OODA loop provides a framework for agent decision-making. Effective agents minimize the time through this loop while maximizing the quality of decisions.

    "explanation": "Multi-agent systems introduce complexities like coordination, communication protocols, and strategic interactions not present in single-agent systems.

    "explanation": "The BDI model provides a framework for practical reasoning in agents.
