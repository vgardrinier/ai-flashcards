# AI Flashcards Application Requirements

## Application Overview
The AI Flashcards application is designed to help users learn about artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs), and AI agents through an interactive flashcard and quiz system. The application will track user progress using an ELO scoring system, allowing users to focus on areas where they need improvement.

## Core Features

### Flashcard System
- Digital flashcards with question on front, answer on back
- Categorization of flashcards by topic and difficulty
- Ability to flip cards and mark them as known/unknown
- Spaced repetition system to optimize learning
- Option to bookmark important flashcards

### Quiz System
- Multiple choice questions derived from flashcard content
- Various quiz modes (timed, untimed, by category, random)
- Immediate feedback on answers
- Detailed explanations for each answer
- Progress tracking across quiz sessions

### ELO Scoring System
- Individual ELO ratings for each topic area
- Score adjustments based on question difficulty and user performance
- Visual representation of progress over time
- Identification of strength/weakness areas
- Personalized recommendations for study focus

### User Experience
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Intuitive, clean user interface
- Progress dashboard with statistics and visualizations
- Customizable study sessions
- Dark/light mode options

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Framework: React.js with TypeScript
- State Management: Redux or Context API
- UI Components: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
- Animations: Framer Motion for card flipping and transitions
- Charts: Chart.js for progress visualization

### Backend
- Framework: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB for flexible schema design
- Authentication: JWT for user sessions
- API: RESTful endpoints for data operations
- Caching: Redis for performance optimization

### Database Schema (High-Level)
- Users collection: User profiles and progress data
- Flashcards collection: Question/answer pairs with metadata
- Categories collection: Topic hierarchies and relationships
- UserProgress collection: ELO scores and study history
- QuizSessions collection: Records of completed quizzes

### Deployment
- Containerization: Docker for consistent environments
- Hosting: Vercel for frontend, Heroku for backend
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Monitoring: Sentry for error tracking
