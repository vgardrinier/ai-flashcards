# Tech CTO Skills for AI

## Strategic Leadership
- **AI Adoption Strategy**: Determining the company's posture for AI adoption and developing practical communications and access policies
- **Business Value Identification**: Identifying use cases that build value through improved productivity, growth, and new business models
- **Financial AI (FinAI)**: Developing capabilities to estimate true costs and returns of AI initiatives
- **Technology Function Reimagination**: Focusing on building AI capabilities in software development, accelerating technical debt reduction, and reducing manual effort in IT operations

## Technical Expertise
- **Model Selection and Adaptation**: Taking advantage of existing services or adapting open-source AI models to develop proprietary capabilities
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Upgrading technology architecture to integrate and manage AI models and orchestrate how they operate with existing systems
- **Data Architecture**: Developing architectures to enable access to quality data by processing both structured and unstructured data sources
- **Platform Development**: Creating centralized, cross-functional AI platform teams to provide approved models to product and application teams

## Team Development
- **Talent Upskilling**: Investing in training for key roles (software developers, data engineers, MLOps engineers, security experts)
- **Role-Based Training**: Tailoring training programs by roles and proficiency levels due to varying impact of AI
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Building teams that span technical and business domains

## Risk Management
- **Risk Landscape Evaluation**: Assessing new risks introduced by AI technologies
- **Mitigation Practices**: Establishing ongoing practices to address model, data, and policy risks
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring responsible AI use and addressing bias, privacy, and security concerns

## Infrastructure and Scaling
- **AI Infrastructure**: Building scalable architectures for AI workloads
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizing computing resources for AI model training and inference
- **Technical Debt Management**: Reviewing and reducing technical debt to accelerate AI adoption
- **Automation**: Implementing DevSecOps practices to manage increased code volume and complexity

## AI Implementation Areas
- **Software Development**: Using AI to help engineers develop code 35-45% faster, refactor code 20-30% faster, and perform documentation 45-50% faster
- **IT Operations**: Dramatically reducing manual effort through AI automation
- **Customer Support**: Improving productivity by up to 40% through intelligent bots and AI assistants
- **Marketing**: Lifting productivity by approximately 10% by analyzing unstructured data for customer preferences

## Challenges and Considerations
- **Cost Management**: Understanding the complex unit economics of AI (model costs, vendor costs, usage fees, human oversight)
- **Build vs. Buy Decisions**: Evaluating when to build custom models (which can cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars) versus using existing services
- **Integration Complexity**: Managing the interaction between multiple AI models, each with its own fee structure and performance characteristics
- **Scaling Beyond Pilots**: Applying lessons from previous technology waves to move beyond experiments to sustainable business value
